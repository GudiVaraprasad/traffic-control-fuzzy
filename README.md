# A NOVEL APPROACH USING FUZZY LOGIC TO DETECT TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEMS

This project report proposes a fuzzy traffic control system based on fuzzy logic theory. This suggested system may effectively manage traffic junctions’ congestion by regulating the time length of the green phase interval. Fuzzy logic may be developed on top of specialized knowledge and integrated with traditional control approaches; however, rather than replacing traditional control methods, fuzzy control systems simplify the implementation process in many circumstances. The primary objectives are to improve traffic safety at the junction, maximize capacity at the intersection, and minimize delays. In order to govern signal timings, a fuzzy logic controller may utilize linguistic and imprecise traffic data. The growing number of automobiles and road shortages cause traffic congestion in many places, affecting efficiency, productivity, and energy losses. The traffic signal controller operating approach at road junctions is a key contributor to this congestion.
